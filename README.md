# Speed-reducer-spur-gear-for-conveyor-belt
The aim is to create an initial design with mathematical computation for efficient gearbox. The project empathizes the selection of material and deciding the best gears for 3D CAD modelling under specified conditions. The final design is a result of comprehensive research and analytical calculations for torque transmission and speed reduction.
